## Limiting Blocks (Advanced)
To limit the blocks available in this tutorial, include the necessary `namespace` and `block` filters. This section is a placeholder for specifying those restrictions. Adjust it based on the blocks you want to make available to the users.

```package
microbit
```

```filter
blocks--basic
```

Remember to replace the placeholders with the actual block codes and namespaces you want to include in your tutorial.
